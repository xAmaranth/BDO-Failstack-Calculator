# BDO-Failstack-Calculator
An application that calculates the value of a failstack in Black Desert Online, and recommends a method to enhance optimally.

In Black Desert Online (BDO), gear progression is achieved through a method called Enhancing, in which there is a chance that an enhancement attempt succeeds or fails.
The chance for an enhancement's success or failure is influenced by the player's current failstack, or, in other chance-based games like gachas, their current pity.

Enhancing cheaply is achieved by failing enhancements that are cheap to attempt as much as possible to build a high failstack before attempting an enhancement that is much 
more expensive. Since the price point of enhancing materials vary from day-to-day thanks to the active in game economy, and since failstacks are lost entirely if an
enhancement is successful, it is difficult for a player to gauge exactly how to failstack well or optimally.
